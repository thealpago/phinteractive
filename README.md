# Interactive Image Particles

An interactive web experience that creates stunning particle effects from photographs using Three.js and WebGL. This project demonstrates how to transform static images into dynamic, responsive particle systems that react to user interactions.

## Features

- 🖼️ **Photograph to Particle Conversion**: Transform any image into interactive particles
- 🎯 **Mouse & Touch Interaction**: Particles react dynamically to user input
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized rendering using off-screen textures
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- 🎨 **Customizable Settings**: Adjustable particle behavior through interactive controls
